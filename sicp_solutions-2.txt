## Exercise 2.1 ##

	(define (make-rat n d)
		(if (< d 0)
			(make-rat (* -1 n) (* -1 d))
			(let ((g (abs (gcd n d))))
		 		(cons (/ n g) (/ d g)))))

## Exercise 2.2 ##
	(define (midpoint-segment s)
		(make-point (/ (- (x-point (end-segment s)) (x-point (start-segment s))) 2)
			(/ (- (y-point (end-segment s)) (y-point (start-segment s))) 2)))

## Exercise 2.3 ##
Perimeter and area are calculated in terms of width and height of the rectangle:

	(define (perimeter rect)
		(+ (* 2 (height rect)) (* 2 (width rect))))
	(define (area rect)
		(* (height rect) (width rect)))

One representation, based on an origin point and scalars for width and height:

	(define (make-rect origin height width)
		(cons origin (cons height width)))
	(define (origin rect) (car rect))
	(define (height rect) (car (cdr rect)))
	(define (width rect) (cdr (cdr rect)))

Another, where the rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right point:

	(define (make-rect topleft bottomright)
		(cons topleft bottomright))
	(define (origin rect) (car rect))
	(define (height rect) (abs (- (y-point (cdr rect)) (y-point (car rect)))))
	(define (width rect) (abs (- (x-point (cdr rect)) (x-point (car rect)))))
